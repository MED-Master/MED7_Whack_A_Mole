To setup such version simply chose  proper lw or hd  version in package manager and install it.
We advice to setup fresh unity project and chose hd or lw pipline at start. 
It's very difficult to setup render pipline yourself in engine and upgrade standard project.

RP technology is  very fluid and it's not possible to support bigger range of versions. 

LW RP - It's basicly very stable and all our functions and shaders work there properly.
HD RP - very fluid and unstable.
